# How to Run SentinelLite-SOC

🛡️ This guide explains how to run the **SentinelLite-SOC** platform on your machine, either **locally with Python** or **using Docker**.

---

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or higher
* pip (Python package manager)
* Docker & Docker Compose (optional, for containerized run)
* Git (to clone the repository)

---

## 1️⃣ Running Locally with Python

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yosr200/SentinelLite-SOC.git
cd SentinelLite-SOC
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Run the SOC workflow

This parses logs, detects brute-force attacks, generates alerts, and simulates responses.

```bash
python run_soc.py
```

### Step 4: Start the Flask dashboard

```bash
cd dashboard
python app.py
```

### Step 5: Open the dashboard in your browser

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

* You will see alerts generated from the sample logs.
* Alerts include **detected brute-force attempts** and their **severity**.

---

## 2️⃣ Running with Docker (Recommended)

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yosr200/SentinelLite-SOC.git
cd SentinelLite-SOC
```

### Step 2: Build and start Docker containers

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

* Starts two containers:

  * **SOC engine** – runs detection and alert workflow
  * **Dashboard** – Flask web interface

### Step 3: Open the dashboard

```
http://localhost:5000
```

* Alerts update in real-time
* Sample logs are preloaded for testing

---

## 3️⃣ Customizing Logs

* Add your own logs to `sample_logs/` (e.g., `auth.log`)
* Modify detection thresholds in `detections/brute_force_detector.py` if needed

---

## 4️⃣ Notes

* Alerts are saved in `alerts.json`
* Automated response (IP blocking) is **simulated only**; system firewall is not modified by default
* To enable real blocking, edit `response/block_ip.py` and set `simulate=False`

---

## 5️⃣ Recommended Next Steps

* Explore `docs/architecture.md` for the SOC architecture diagram
* Modify detection rules to simulate other attack patterns
* Use Docker for portability across environments

---

Enjoy testing your **SentinelLite-SOC** platform! 🛡️
